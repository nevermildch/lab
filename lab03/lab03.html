                <p>Bootstrap is the most popular HTML, CSS, and JavaScript framework for developing responsive, mobile-first web sites Bootstrap is a free and open-source front-end web framework for designing websites and web applications. It contains HTML-
                    and CSS-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation and other interface components, as well as optional JavaScript extensions. Unlike many web frameworks, it concerns itself with front-end development only.</p>

                <p>Bootstrap is a framework, because it provides structure instead of simply being a library of predefined elements and styles.Bootstrap, originally named Twitter Blueprint, was developed by Mark Otto and Jacob Thornton at Twitter as a framework
                    to encourage consistency across internal tools. Before Bootstrap, various libraries were used for interface development, which led to inconsistencies and a high maintenance burden.</p>

                <p>Bootstrap is compatible with the latest versions of the Google Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, Opera, and Safari browsers, although some of these browsers are not supported on all platforms. Since version 2.0 it also supports responsive
                    web design. This means the layout of web pages adjusts dynamically, taking into account the characteristics of the device used (desktop, tablet, mobile phone). Starting with version 3.0, Bootstrap adopted a mobile-first design philosophy,
                    emphasizing responsive design by default. The version 4.0 alpha release added Sass and Flexbox support. Bootstrap is open source and available on GitHub. Developers are encouraged to participate in the project and make their own contributions
                    to the platform.</p>

                <p>Bootstrap is modular and consists essentially of a series of Less stylesheets that implement the various components of the toolkit. A stylesheet called "Bootstrap less" includes the components stylesheets. Developers can adapt the Bootstrap
                    file itself, selecting the components they wish to use in their projects. Adjustments are possible to a limited extent through a central configuration stylesheet. More profound changes are possible by the Less declarations.
                    <h2>Stylesheets</h2>Bootstrap provides a set of stylesheets that provide basic style definitions for all key HTML components. These provide a uniform, modern appearance for formatting text, tables and form elements.
                    <h2>Re-usable components</h2>In addition to the regular HTML elements, Bootstrap contains other commonly used interface elements. The components are implemented as CSS classes, which must be applied to certain HTML elements in a page.
                    <h2>JavaScript components</h2>Bootstrap comes with several JavaScript components in the form of jQuery plugins. They provide additional user interface elements such as dialog boxes, tooltips, and carousels. They also extend the functionality
                    of some existing interface elements, including for example an auto-complete function for input fields. In version 2.0, the following JavaScript plugins are supported: Modal, Dropdown, Scrollspy, Tab, Tooltip, Popover, Alert, Button,
                    Collapse, Carousel and Typeahead.</p>
